# SOCD Cleaner

A software based SOCD Cleaner written in [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com), for Windows.

From [Hit Box Arcade](https://www.hitboxarcade.com/blogs/support/what-is-socd):

> SOCD means "Simultaneous Opposing Cardinal Directions." It is the physical actuation of cardinal directions that are separate and opposite to each other - ie, pressing Left and Right at the same time. This phenomenon is best known on all-button controllers, such as the Hit Box and Smash Box, but current controllers like the Dual-Shock 4 can do something similar with its cross-directional (Analog Stick and Dpad) inputs.

By default it assumes the following button setup:

* Left: <kbd>E</kbd>
* Crouch: <kbd>R</kbd>
* Right: <kbd>F</kbd>
* Space: <kbd>Space</kbd>

Note: Run it as Administrator if your game is also running as Administrator.
